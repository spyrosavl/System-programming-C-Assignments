In this assignment I made an search engine using an Inverted Index struct (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index).
The main features of this search engine are:
1) /search keyword1 keyword2 ... keywordN
2) /df (print the document frequency vector)
3) /tf Document_id word (prints the number of times word is in document with id = Document_id)

*Usage of STL library was permitted in this assignement
Compilation: make
Run ./search -i Entertainment.txt -k 5
