45 Information about Project Gutenberg one page
46 We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
47 fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
48 to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
49 searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
50 projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
51 per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
52 million dollars per hour this year we will have to do four text
53 files per month thus upping our productivity from one million
54 The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
55 Files by the December 31 2001 [10000 x 100000000=Trillion]
56 This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
57 which is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end
58 of the year 2001

193 THE SONNETS
194 by William Shakespeare
195 1
196 From fairest creatures we desire increase
197 That thereby beauty's rose might never die
198 But as the riper should by time decease
199 His tender heir might bear his memory
200 But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
201 Feed'st thy light's flame with selfsubstantial fuel
202 Making a famine where abundance lies
203 Thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
204 Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
205 And only herald to the gaudy spring
206 Within thine own bud buriest thy content
207 And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding
208 Pity the world or else this glutton be
209 To eat the world's due by the grave and thee
210 2
211 When forty winters shall besiege thy brow
212 And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field
213 Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now
214 Will be a tattered weed of small worth held
215 Then being asked where all thy beauty lies
216 Where all the treasure of thy lusty days
217 To say within thine own deep sunken eyes
218 Were an alleating shame and thriftless praise
219 How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
220 If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
221 Shall sum my count and make my old excuse'
222 Proving his beauty by succession thine
223 This were to be new made when thou art old
224 And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold
225 3
226 Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
227 Now is the time that face should form another
228 Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
229 Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
230 For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
231 Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
232 Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
233 Of his selflove to stop posterity
234 Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
235 Calls back the lovely April of her prime
236 So thou through windows of thine age shalt see
237 Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
238 But if thou live remembered not to be
239 Die single and thine image dies with thee
240 4
241 Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
242 Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy
243 Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend
244 And being frank she lends to those are free
245 Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
246 The bounteous largess given thee to give
247 Profitless usurer why dost thou use
248 So great a sum of sums yet canst not live
249 For having traffic with thy self alone
250 Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive
251 Then how when nature calls thee to be gone
252 What acceptable audit canst thou leave
253 Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee
254 Which used lives th executor to be
255 5
256 Those hours that with gentle work did frame
257 The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
258 Will play the tyrants to the very same
259 And that unfair which fairly doth excel
260 For neverresting time leads summer on
261 To hideous winter and confounds him there
262 Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
263 Beauty o'ersnowed and bareness every where
264 Then were not summer's distillation left
265 A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
266 Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft
267 Nor it nor no remembrance what it was
268 But flowers distilled though they with winter meet
269 Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
270 6
271 Then let not winter's ragged hand deface
272 In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled
273 Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
274 With beauty's treasure ere it be selfkilled
275 That use is not forbidden usury
276 Which happies those that pay the willing loan
277 That's for thy self to breed another thee
278 Or ten times happier be it ten for one
279 Ten times thy self were happier than thou art
280 If ten of thine ten times refigured thee
281 Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
282 Leaving thee living in posterity
283 Be not selfwilled for thou art much too fair
284 To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir
285 7
286 Lo in the orient when the gracious light
287 Lifts up his burning head each under eye
288 Doth homage to his newappearing sight
289 Serving with looks his sacred majesty
290 And having climbed the steepup heavenly hill
291 Resembling strong youth in his middle age
292 Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
293 Attending on his golden pilgrimage
294 But when from highmost pitch with weary car
295 Like feeble age he reeleth from the day
296 The eyes fore duteous now converted are
297 From his low tract and look another way
298 So thou thy self outgoing in thy noon
299 Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son
300 8
301 Music to hear why hear'st thou music sadly
302 Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
303 Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly
304 Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy
305 If the true concord of welltuned sounds
306 By unions married do offend thine ear
307 They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
308 In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
309 Mark how one string sweet husband to another
310 Strikes each in each by mutual ordering
311 Resembling sire and child and happy mother
312 Who all in one one pleasing note do sing
313 Whose speechless song being many seeming one
314 Sings this to thee 'Thou single wilt prove none'
315 9
316 Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye
317 That thou consum'st thy self in single life
318 Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
319 The world will wail thee like a makeless wife
320 The world will be thy widow and still weep
321 That thou no form of thee hast left behind
322 When every private widow well may keep
323 By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind
324 Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
325 Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
326 But beauty's waste hath in the world an end
327 And kept unused the user so destroys it
328 No love toward others in that bosom sits
329 That on himself such murd'rous shame commits
330 10
331 For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any
332 Who for thy self art so unprovident
333 Grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
334 But that thou none lov'st is most evident
335 For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate
336 That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire
337 Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
338 Which to repair should be thy chief desire
339 O change thy thought that I may change my mind
340 Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
341 Be as thy presence is gracious and kind
342 Or to thy self at least kindhearted prove
343 Make thee another self for love of me
344 That beauty still may live in thine or thee
345 11
346 As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st
347 In one of thine from that which thou departest
348 And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st
349 Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
350 Herein lives wisdom beauty and increase
351 Without this folly age and cold decay
352 If all were minded so the times should cease
353 And threescore year would make the world away
354 Let those whom nature hath not made for store
355 Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
356 Look whom she best endowed she gave thee more
357 Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
358 She carved thee for her seal and meant thereby
359 Thou shouldst print more not let that copy die
360 12
361 When I do count the clock that tells the time
362 And see the brave day sunk in hideous night
363 When I behold the violet past prime
364 And sable curls all silvered o'er with white
365 When lofty trees I see barren of leaves
366 Which erst from heat did canopy the herd
367 And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
368 Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
369 Then of thy beauty do I question make
370 That thou among the wastes of time must go
371 Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
372 And die as fast as they see others grow
373 And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
374 Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence
375 13
376 O that you were your self but love you are
377 No longer yours than you your self here live
378 Against this coming end you should prepare
379 And your sweet semblance to some other give
380 So should that beauty which you hold in lease
381 Find no determination then you were
382 Your self again after your self's decease
383 When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
384 Who lets so fair a house fall to decay
385 Which husbandry in honour might uphold
386 Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
387 And barren rage of death's eternal cold
388 O none but unthrifts dear my love you know
389 You had a father let your son say so
390 14
391 Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck
392 And yet methinks I have astronomy
393 But not to tell of good or evil luck
394 Of plagues of dearths or seasons quality
395 Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell
396 Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
397 Or say with princes if it shall go well
398 By oft predict that I in heaven find
399 But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive
400 And constant stars in them I read such art
401 As truth and beauty shall together thrive
402 If from thy self to store thou wouldst convert
403 Or else of thee this I prognosticate
404 Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date
405 15
406 When I consider every thing that grows
407 Holds in perfection but a little moment
408 That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
409 Whereon the stars in secret influence comment
410 When I perceive that men as plants increase
411 Cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky
412 Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease
413 And wear their brave state out of memory
414 Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
415 Sets you most rich in youth before my sight
416 Where wasteful time debateth with decay
417 To change your day of youth to sullied night
418 And all in war with Time for love of you
419 As he takes from you I engraft you new
420 16
421 But wherefore do not you a mightier way
422 Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time
423 And fortify your self in your decay
424 With means more blessed than my barren rhyme
425 Now stand you on the top of happy hours
426 And many maiden gardens yet unset
427 With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers
428 Much liker than your painted counterfeit
429 So should the lines of life that life repair
430 Which this Time's pencil or my pupil pen
431 Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
432 Can make you live your self in eyes of men
433 To give away your self keeps your self still
434 And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill
435 17
436 Who will believe my verse in time to come
437 If it were filled with your most high deserts
438 Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
439 Which hides your life and shows not half your parts
440 If I could write the beauty of your eyes
441 And in fresh numbers number all your graces
442 The age to come would say this poet lies
443 Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces
444 So should my papers yellowed with their age
445 Be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue
446 And your true rights be termed a poet's rage
447 And stretched metre of an antique song
448 But were some child of yours alive that time
449 You should live twice in it and in my rhyme
450 18
451 Shall I compare thee to a summer's day
452 Thou art more lovely and more temperate
453 Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
454 And summer's lease hath all too short a date
455 Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
456 And often is his gold complexion dimmed
457 And every fair from fair sometime declines
458 By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed
459 But thy eternal summer shall not fade
460 Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st
461 Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade
462 When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st
463 So long as men can breathe or eyes can see
464 So long lives this and this gives life to thee
465 19
466 Devouring Time blunt thou the lion's paws
467 And make the earth devour her own sweet brood
468 Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws
469 And burn the longlived phoenix in her blood
470 Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st
471 And do whate'er thou wilt swiftfooted Time
472 To the wide world and all her fading sweets
473 But I forbid thee one most heinous crime
474 O carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow
475 Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
476 Him in thy course untainted do allow
477 For beauty's pattern to succeeding men
478 Yet do thy worst old Time despite thy wrong
479 My love shall in my verse ever live young
480 20
481 A woman's face with nature's own hand painted
482 Hast thou the master mistress of my passion
483 A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
484 With shifting change as is false women's fashion
485 An eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling
486 Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
487 A man in hue all hues in his controlling
488 Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth
489 And for a woman wert thou first created
490 Till nature as she wrought thee fell adoting
491 And by addition me of thee defeated
492 By adding one thing to my purpose nothing
493 But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure
494 Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure
495 21
496 So is it not with me as with that muse
497 Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse
498 Who heaven it self for ornament doth use
499 And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
500 Making a couplement of proud compare
501 With sun and moon with earth and sea's rich gems
502 With April's firstborn flowers and all things rare
503 That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems
504 O let me true in love but truly write
505 And then believe me my love is as fair
506 As any mother's child though not so bright
507 As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air
508 Let them say more that like of hearsay well
509 I will not praise that purpose not to sell
510 22
511 My glass shall not persuade me I am old
512 So long as youth and thou are of one date
513 But when in thee time's furrows I behold
514 Then look I death my days should expiate
515 For all that beauty that doth cover thee
516 Is but the seemly raiment of my heart
517 Which in thy breast doth live as thine in me
518 How can I then be elder than thou art
519 O therefore love be of thyself so wary
520 As I not for my self but for thee will
521 Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary
522 As tender nurse her babe from faring ill
523 Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain
524 Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again
525 23
526 As an unperfect actor on the stage
527 Who with his fear is put beside his part
528 Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
529 Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart
530 So I for fear of trust forget to say
531 The perfect ceremony of love's rite
532 And in mine own love's strength seem to decay
533 O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might
534 O let my looks be then the eloquence
535 And dumb presagers of my speaking breast
536 Who plead for love and look for recompense
537 More than that tongue that more hath more expressed
538 O learn to read what silent love hath writ
539 To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit
540 24
541 Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled
542 Thy beauty's form in table of my heart
543 My body is the frame wherein 'tis held
544 And perspective it is best painter's art
545 For through the painter must you see his skill
546 To find where your true image pictured lies
547 Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still
548 That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes
549 Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
550 Mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
551 Are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun
552 Delights to peep to gaze therein on thee
553 Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
554 They draw but what they see know not the heart
555 25
556 Let those who are in favour with their stars
557 Of public honour and proud titles boast
558 Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars
559 Unlooked for joy in that I honour most
560 Great princes favourites their fair leaves spread
561 But as the marigold at the sun's eye
562 And in themselves their pride lies buried
563 For at a frown they in their glory die
564 The painful warrior famoused for fight
565 After a thousand victories once foiled
566 Is from the book of honour razed quite
567 And all the rest forgot for which he toiled
568 Then happy I that love and am beloved
569 Where I may not remove nor be removed
570 26
571 Lord of my love to whom in vassalage
572 Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit
573 To thee I send this written embassage
574 To witness duty not to show my wit
575 Duty so great which wit so poor as mine
576 May make seem bare in wanting words to show it
577 But that I hope some good conceit of thine
578 In thy soul's thought all naked will bestow it
579 Till whatsoever star that guides my moving
580 Points on me graciously with fair aspect
581 And puts apparel on my tattered loving
582 To show me worthy of thy sweet respect
583 Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee
584 Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me
585 27
586 Weary with toil I haste me to my bed
587 The dear respose for limbs with travel tired
588 But then begins a journey in my head
589 To work my mind when body's work's expired
590 For then my thoughts from far where I abide
591 Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
592 And keep my drooping eyelids open wide
593 Looking on darkness which the blind do see
594 Save that my soul's imaginary sight
595 Presents thy shadow to my sightless view
596 Which like a jewel hung in ghastly night
597 Makes black night beauteous and her old face new
598 Lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind
599 For thee and for my self no quiet find
600 28
601 How can I then return in happy plight
602 That am debarred the benefit of rest
603 When day's oppression is not eased by night
604 But day by night and night by day oppressed
605 And each though enemies to either's reign
606 Do in consent shake hands to torture me
607 The one by toil the other to complain
608 How far I toil still farther off from thee
609 I tell the day to please him thou art bright
610 And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
611 So flatter I the swartcomplexioned night
612 When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even
613 But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
614 And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger
615 29
616 When in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes
617 I all alone beweep my outcast state
618 And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
619 And look upon my self and curse my fate
620 Wishing me like to one more rich in hope
621 Featured like him like him with friends possessed
622 Desiring this man's art and that man's scope
623 With what I most enjoy contented least
624 Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising
625 Haply I think on thee and then my state
626 Like to the lark at break of day arising
627 From sullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate
628 For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
629 That then I scorn to change my state with kings
630 30
631 When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
632 I summon up remembrance of things past
633 I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought
634 And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste
635 Then can I drown an eye unused to flow
636 For precious friends hid in death's dateless night
637 And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe
638 And moan th expense of many a vanished sight
639 Then can I grieve at grievances foregone
640 And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
641 The sad account of forebemoaned moan
642 Which I new pay as if not paid before
643 But if the while I think on thee dear friend
644 All losses are restored and sorrows end
645 31
646 Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
647 Which I by lacking have supposed dead
648 And there reigns love and all love's loving parts
649 And all those friends which I thought buried
650 How many a holy and obsequious tear
651 Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye
652 As interest of the dead which now appear
653 But things removed that hidden in thee lie
654 Thou art the grave where buried love doth live
655 Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
656 Who all their parts of me to thee did give
657 That due of many now is thine alone
658 Their images I loved I view in thee
659 And thou all they hast all the all of me
660 32
661 If thou survive my wellcontented day
662 When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
663 And shalt by fortune once more resurvey
664 These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
665 Compare them with the bett'ring of the time
666 And though they be outstripped by every pen
667 Reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
668 Exceeded by the height of happier men
669 O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
670 'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age
671 A dearer birth than this his love had brought
672 To march in ranks of better equipage
673 But since he died and poets better prove
674 Theirs for their style I'll read his for his love'
675 33
676 Full many a glorious morning have I seen
677 Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye
678 Kissing with golden face the meadows green
679 Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
680 Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
681 With ugly rack on his celestial face
682 And from the forlorn world his visage hide
683 Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
684 Even so my sun one early morn did shine
685 With all triumphant splendour on my brow
686 But out alack he was but one hour mine
687 The region cloud hath masked him from me now
688 Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
689 Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth
690 34
691 Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
692 And make me travel forth without my cloak
693 To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way
694 Hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke
695 'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
696 To dry the rain on my stormbeaten face
697 For no man well of such a salve can speak
698 That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace
699 Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
700 Though thou repent yet I have still the loss
701 Th offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
702 To him that bears the strong offence's cross
703 Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
704 And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds
705 35
706 No more be grieved at that which thou hast done
707 Roses have thorns and silver fountains mud
708 Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
709 And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
710 All men make faults and even I in this
711 Authorizing thy trespass with compare
712 My self corrupting salving thy amiss
713 Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
714 For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense
715 Thy adverse party is thy advocate
716 And 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence
717 Such civil war is in my love and hate
718 That I an accessary needs must be
719 To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me
720 36
721 Let me confess that we two must be twain
722 Although our undivided loves are one
723 So shall those blots that do with me remain
724 Without thy help by me be borne alone
725 In our two loves there is but one respect
726 Though in our lives a separable spite
727 Which though it alter not love's sole effect
728 Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight
729 I may not evermore acknowledge thee
730 Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
731 Nor thou with public kindness honour me
732 Unless thou take that honour from thy name
733 But do not so I love thee in such sort
734 As thou being mine mine is thy good report
735 37
736 As a decrepit father takes delight
737 To see his active child do deeds of youth
738 So I made lame by Fortune's dearest spite
739 Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
740 For whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
741 Or any of these all or all or more
742 Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit
743 I make my love engrafted to this store
744 So then I am not lame poor nor despised
745 Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
746 That I in thy abundance am sufficed
747 And by a part of all thy glory live
748 Look what is best that best I wish in thee
749 This wish I have then ten times happy me
750 38
751 How can my muse want subject to invent
752 While thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse
753 Thine own sweet argument too excellent
754 For every vulgar paper to rehearse
755 O give thy self the thanks if aught in me
756 Worthy perusal stand against thy sight
757 For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee
758 When thou thy self dost give invention light
759 Be thou the tenth Muse ten times more in worth
760 Than those old nine which rhymers invocate
761 And he that calls on thee let him bring forth
762 Eternal numbers to outlive long date
763 If my slight muse do please these curious days
764 The pain be mine but thine shall be the praise
765 39
766 O how thy worth with manners may I sing
767 When thou art all the better part of me
768 What can mine own praise to mine own self bring
769 And what is't but mine own when I praise thee
770 Even for this let us divided live
771 And our dear love lose name of single one
772 That by this separation I may give
773 That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone
774 O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
775 Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
776 To entertain the time with thoughts of love
777 Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
778 And that thou teachest how to make one twain
779 By praising him here who doth hence remain
780 40
781 Take all my loves my love yea take them all
782 What hast thou then more than thou hadst before
783 No love my love that thou mayst true love call
784 All mine was thine before thou hadst this more
785 Then if for my love thou my love receivest
786 I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest
787 But yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivest
788 By wilful taste of what thy self refusest
789 I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
790 Although thou steal thee all my poverty
791 And yet love knows it is a greater grief
792 To bear greater wrong than hate's known injury
793 Lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
794 Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes
795 41
796 Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits
797 When I am sometime absent from thy heart
798 Thy beauty and thy years full well befits
799 For still temptation follows where thou art
800 Gentle thou art and therefore to be won
801 Beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed
802 And when a woman woos what woman's son
803 Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed
804 Ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear
805 And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth
806 Who lead thee in their riot even there
807 Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth
808 Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee
809 Thine by thy beauty being false to me
810 42
811 That thou hast her it is not all my grief
812 And yet it may be said I loved her dearly
813 That she hath thee is of my wailing chief
814 A loss in love that touches me more nearly
815 Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye
816 Thou dost love her because thou know'st I love her
817 And for my sake even so doth she abuse me
818 Suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her
819 If I lose thee my loss is my love's gain
820 And losing her my friend hath found that loss
821 Both find each other and I lose both twain
822 And both for my sake lay on me this cross
823 But here's the joy my friend and I are one
824 Sweet flattery then she loves but me alone
825 43
826 When most I wink then do mine eyes best see
827 For all the day they view things unrespected
828 But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee
829 And darkly bright are bright in dark directed
830 Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
831 How would thy shadow's form form happy show
832 To the clear day with thy much clearer light
833 When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
834 How would I say mine eyes be blessed made
835 By looking on thee in the living day
836 When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
837 Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
838 All days are nights to see till I see thee
839 And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me
840 44
841 If the dull substance of my flesh were thought
842 Injurious distance should not stop my way
843 For then despite of space I would be brought
844 From limits far remote where thou dost stay
845 No matter then although my foot did stand
846 Upon the farthest earth removed from thee
847 For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
848 As soon as think the place where he would be
849 But ah thought kills me that I am not thought
850 To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
851 But that so much of earth and water wrought
852 I must attend time's leisure with my moan
853 Receiving nought by elements so slow
854 But heavy tears badges of either's woe
855 45
856 The other two slight air and purging fire
857 Are both with thee wherever I abide
858 The first my thought the other my desire
859 These presentabsent with swift motion slide
860 For when these quicker elements are gone
861 In tender embassy of love to thee
862 My life being made of four with two alone
863 Sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy
864 Until life's composition be recured
865 By those swift messengers returned from thee
866 Who even but now come back again assured
867 Of thy fair health recounting it to me
868 This told I joy but then no longer glad
869 I send them back again and straight grow sad
870 46
871 Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
872 How to divide the conquest of thy sight
873 Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar
874 My heart mine eye the freedom of that right
875 My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie
876 A closet never pierced with crystal eyes
877 But the defendant doth that plea deny
878 And says in him thy fair appearance lies
879 To side this title is impanelled
880 A quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
881 And by their verdict is determined
882 The clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part
883 As thus mine eye's due is thy outward part
884 And my heart's right thy inward love of heart
885 47
886 Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took
887 And each doth good turns now unto the other
888 When that mine eye is famished for a look
889 Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother
890 With my love's picture then my eye doth feast
891 And to the painted banquet bids my heart
892 Another time mine eye is my heart's guest
893 And in his thoughts of love doth share a part
894 So either by thy picture or my love
895 Thy self away art present still with me
896 For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move
897 And I am still with them and they with thee
898 Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
899 Awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight
900 48
901 How careful was I when I took my way
902 Each trifle under truest bars to thrust
903 That to my use it might unused stay
904 From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust
905 But thou to whom my jewels trifles are
906 Most worthy comfort now my greatest grief
907 Thou best of dearest and mine only care
908 Art left the prey of every vulgar thief
909 Thee have I not locked up in any chest
910 Save where thou art not though I feel thou art
911 Within the gentle closure of my breast
912 From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
913 And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear
914 For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear
915 49
916 Against that time if ever that time come
917 When I shall see thee frown on my defects
918 When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
919 Called to that audit by advised respects
920 Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
921 And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye
922 When love converted from the thing it was
923 Shall reasons find of settled gravity
924 Against that time do I ensconce me here
925 Within the knowledge of mine own desert
926 And this my hand against my self uprear
927 To guard the lawful reasons on thy part
928 To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws
929 Since why to love I can allege no cause
930 50
931 How heavy do I journey on the way
932 When what I seek my weary travel's end
933 Doth teach that case and that repose to say
934 'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend'
935 The beast that bears me tired with my woe
936 Plods dully on to bear that weight in me
937 As if by some instinct the wretch did know
938 His rider loved not speed being made from thee
939 The bloody spur cannot provoke him on
940 That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
941 Which heavily he answers with a groan
942 More sharp to me than spurring to his side
943 For that same groan doth put this in my mind
944 My grief lies onward and my joy behind
945 51
946 Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
947 Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed
948 From where thou art why should I haste me thence
949 Till I return of posting is no need
950 O what excuse will my poor beast then find
951 When swift extremity can seem but slow
952 Then should I spur though mounted on the wind
953 In winged speed no motion shall I know
954 Then can no horse with my desire keep pace
955 Therefore desire of perfect'st love being made
956 Shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race
957 But love for love thus shall excuse my jade
958 Since from thee going he went wilfulslow
959 Towards thee I'll run and give him leave to go
960 52
961 So am I as the rich whose blessed key
962 Can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure
963 The which he will not every hour survey
964 For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
965 Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare
966 Since seldom coming in that long year set
967 Like stones of worth they thinly placed are
968 Or captain jewels in the carcanet
969 So is the time that keeps you as my chest
970 Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
971 To make some special instant specialblest
972 By new unfolding his imprisoned pride
973 Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
974 Being had to triumph being lacked to hope
975 53
976 What is your substance whereof are you made
977 That millions of strange shadows on you tend
978 Since every one hath every one one shade
979 And you but one can every shadow lend
980 Describe Adonis and the counterfeit
981 Is poorly imitated after you
982 On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set
983 And you in Grecian tires are painted new
984 Speak of the spring and foison of the year
985 The one doth shadow of your beauty show
986 The other as your bounty doth appear
987 And you in every blessed shape we know
988 In all external grace you have some part
989 But you like none none you for constant heart
990 54
991 O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
992 By that sweet ornament which truth doth give
993 The rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
994 For that sweet odour which doth in it live
995 The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
996 As the perfumed tincture of the roses
997 Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
998 When summer's breath their masked buds discloses
999 But for their virtue only is their show
1000 They live unwooed and unrespected fade
1001 Die to themselves Sweet roses do not so
1002 Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
1003 And so of you beauteous and lovely youth
1004 When that shall vade by verse distills your truth
1005 55
1006 Not marble nor the gilded monuments
1007 Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
1008 But you shall shine more bright in these contents
1009 Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time
1010 When wasteful war shall statues overturn
1011 And broils root out the work of masonry
1012 Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn
1013 The living record of your memory
1014 'Gainst death and alloblivious enmity
1015 Shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
1016 Even in the eyes of all posterity
1017 That wear this world out to the ending doom
1018 So till the judgment that your self arise
1019 You live in this and dwell in lovers eyes
1020 56
1021 Sweet love renew thy force be it not said
1022 Thy edge should blunter be than appetite
1023 Which but today by feeding is allayed
1024 Tomorrow sharpened in his former might
1025 So love be thou although today thou fill
1026 Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness
1027 Tomorrow see again and do not kill
1028 The spirit of love with a perpetual dulness
1029 Let this sad interim like the ocean be
1030 Which parts the shore where two contracted new
1031 Come daily to the banks that when they see
1032 Return of love more blest may be the view
1033 Or call it winter which being full of care
1034 Makes summer's welcome thrice more wished more rare
1035 57
1036 Being your slave what should I do but tend
1037 Upon the hours and times of your desire
1038 I have no precious time at all to spend
1039 Nor services to do till you require
1040 Nor dare I chide the worldwithoutend hour
1041 Whilst I my sovereign watch the clock for you
1042 Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
1043 When you have bid your servant once adieu
1044 Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
1045 Where you may be or your affairs suppose
1046 But like a sad slave stay and think of nought
1047 Save where you are how happy you make those
1048 So true a fool is love that in your will
1049 Though you do any thing he thinks no ill
1050 58
1051 That god forbid that made me first your slave
1052 I should in thought control your times of pleasure
1053 Or at your hand th account of hours to crave
1054 Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
1055 O let me suffer being at your beck
1056 Th imprisoned absence of your liberty
1057 And patience tame to sufferance bide each check
1058 Without accusing you of injury
1059 Be where you list your charter is so strong
1060 That you your self may privilage your time
1061 To what you will to you it doth belong
1062 Your self to pardon of selfdoing crime
1063 I am to wait though waiting so be hell
1064 Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well
1065 59
1066 If there be nothing new but that which is
1067 Hath been before how are our brains beguiled
1068 Which labouring for invention bear amis
1069 The second burthen of a former child
1070 O that record could with a backward look
1071 Even of five hundred courses of the sun
1072 Show me your image in some antique book
1073 Since mind at first in character was done
1074 That I might see what the old world could say
1075 To this composed wonder of your frame
1076 Whether we are mended or whether better they
1077 Or whether revolution be the same
1078 O sure I am the wits of former days
1079 To subjects worse have given admiring praise
1080 60
1081 Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
1082 So do our minutes hasten to their end
1083 Each changing place with that which goes before
1084 In sequent toil all forwards do contend
1085 Nativity once in the main of light
1086 Crawls to maturity wherewith being crowned
1087 Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight
1088 And Time that gave doth now his gift confound
1089 Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
1090 And delves the parallels in beauty's brow
1091 Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth
1092 And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
1093 And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
1094 Praising thy worth despite his cruel hand
1095 61
1096 Is it thy will thy image should keep open
1097 My heavy eyelids to the weary night
1098 Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
1099 While shadows like to thee do mock my sight
1100 Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
1101 So far from home into my deeds to pry
1102 To find out shames and idle hours in me
1103 The scope and tenure of thy jealousy
1104 O no thy love though much is not so great
1105 It is my love that keeps mine eye awake
1106 Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
1107 To play the watchman ever for thy sake
1108 For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
1109 From me far off with others all too near
1110 62
1111 Sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye
1112 And all my soul and all my every part
1113 And for this sin there is no remedy
1114 It is so grounded inward in my heart
1115 Methinks no face so gracious is as mine
1116 No shape so true no truth of such account
1117 And for my self mine own worth do define
1118 As I all other in all worths surmount
1119 But when my glass shows me my self indeed
1120 beated and chopt with tanned antiquity
1121 Mine own selflove quite contrary I read
1122 Self so selfloving were iniquity
1123 'Tis thee my self that for my self I praise
1124 Painting my age with beauty of thy days
1125 63
1126 Against my love shall be as I am now
1127 With Time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn
1128 When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
1129 With lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
1130 Hath travelled on to age's steepy night
1131 And all those beauties whereof now he's king
1132 Are vanishing or vanished out of sight
1133 Stealing away the treasure of his spring
1134 For such a time do I now fortify
1135 Against confounding age's cruel knife
1136 That he shall never cut from memory
1137 My sweet love's beauty though my lover's life
1138 His beauty shall in these black lines be seen
1139 And they shall live and he in them still green
1140 64
1141 When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced
1142 The richproud cost of outworn buried age
1143 When sometime lofty towers I see downrased
1144 And brass eternal slave to mortal rage
1145 When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
1146 Advantage on the kingdom of the shore
1147 And the firm soil win of the watery main
1148 Increasing store with loss and loss with store
1149 When I have seen such interchange of State
1150 Or state it self confounded to decay
1151 Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
1152 That Time will come and take my love away
1153 This thought is as a death which cannot choose
1154 But weep to have that which it fears to lose
1155 65
1156 Since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
1157 But sad mortality o'ersways their power
1158 How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
1159 Whose action is no stronger than a flower
1160 O how shall summer's honey breath hold out
1161 Against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days
1162 When rocks impregnable are not so stout
1163 Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays
1164 O fearful meditation where alack
1165 Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid
1166 Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
1167 Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
1168 O none unless this miracle have might
1169 That in black ink my love may still shine bright
1170 66
1171 Tired with all these for restful death I cry
1172 As to behold desert a beggar born
1173 And needy nothing trimmed in jollity
1174 And purest faith unhappily forsworn
1175 And gilded honour shamefully misplaced
1176 And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
1177 And right perfection wrongfully disgraced
1178 And strength by limping sway disabled
1179 And art made tonguetied by authority
1180 And folly doctorlike controlling skill
1181 And simple truth miscalled simplicity
1182 And captive good attending captain ill
1183 Tired with all these from these would I be gone
1184 Save that to die I leave my love alone
1185 67
1186 Ah wherefore with infection should he live
1187 And with his presence grace impiety
1188 That sin by him advantage should achieve
1189 And lace it self with his society
1190 Why should false painting imitate his cheek
1191 And steal dead seeming of his living hue
1192 Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
1193 Roses of shadow since his rose is true
1194 Why should he live now nature bankrupt is
1195 Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins
1196 For she hath no exchequer now but his
1197 And proud of many lives upon his gains
1198 O him she stores to show what wealth she had
1199 In days long since before these last so bad
1200 68
1201 Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn
1202 When beauty lived and died as flowers do now
1203 Before these bastard signs of fair were born
1204 Or durst inhabit on a living brow
1205 Before the golden tresses of the dead
1206 The right of sepulchres were shorn away
1207 To live a second life on second head
1208 Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay
1209 In him those holy antique hours are seen
1210 Without all ornament it self and true
1211 Making no summer of another's green
1212 Robbing no old to dress his beauty new
1213 And him as for a map doth Nature store
1214 To show false Art what beauty was of yore
1215 69
1216 Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view
1217 Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
1218 All tongues the voice of souls give thee that due
1219 Uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
1220 Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned
1221 But those same tongues that give thee so thine own
1222 In other accents do this praise confound
1223 By seeing farther than the eye hath shown
1224 They look into the beauty of thy mind
1225 And that in guess they measure by thy deeds
1226 Then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind
1227 To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
1228 But why thy odour matcheth not thy show
1229 The soil is this that thou dost common grow
1230 70
1231 That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect
1232 For slander's mark was ever yet the fair
1233 The ornament of beauty is suspect
1234 A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air
1235 So thou be good slander doth but approve
1236 Thy worth the greater being wooed of time
1237 For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
1238 And thou present'st a pure unstained prime
1239 Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
1240 Either not assailed or victor being charged
1241 Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
1242 To tie up envy evermore enlarged
1243 If some suspect of ill masked not thy show
1244 Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe
1245 71
1246 No longer mourn for me when I am dead
1247 Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
1248 Give warning to the world that I am fled
1249 From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
1250 Nay if you read this line remember not
1251 The hand that writ it for I love you so
1252 That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
1253 If thinking on me then should make you woe
1254 O if I say you look upon this verse
1255 When I perhaps compounded am with clay
1256 Do not so much as my poor name rehearse
1257 But let your love even with my life decay
1258 Lest the wise world should look into your moan
1259 And mock you with me after I am gone
1260 72
1261 O lest the world should task you to recite
1262 What merit lived in me that you should love
1263 After my death dear love forget me quite
1264 For you in me can nothing worthy prove
1265 Unless you would devise some virtuous lie
1266 To do more for me than mine own desert
1267 And hang more praise upon deceased I
1268 Than niggard truth would willingly impart
1269 O lest your true love may seem false in this
1270 That you for love speak well of me untrue
1271 My name be buried where my body is
1272 And live no more to shame nor me nor you
1273 For I am shamed by that which I bring forth
1274 And so should you to love things nothing worth
1275 73
1276 That time of year thou mayst in me behold
1277 When yellow leaves or none or few do hang
1278 Upon those boughs which shake against the cold
1279 Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang
1280 In me thou seest the twilight of such day
1281 As after sunset fadeth in the west
1282 Which by and by black night doth take away
1283 Death's second self that seals up all in rest
1284 In me thou seest the glowing of such fire
1285 That on the ashes of his youth doth lie
1286 As the deathbed whereon it must expire
1287 Consumed with that which it was nourished by
1288 This thou perceiv'st which makes thy love more strong
1289 To love that well which thou must leave ere long
1290 74
1291 But be contented when that fell arrest
1292 Without all bail shall carry me away
1293 My life hath in this line some interest
1294 Which for memorial still with thee shall stay
1295 When thou reviewest this thou dost review
1296 The very part was consecrate to thee
1297 The earth can have but earth which is his due
1298 My spirit is thine the better part of me
1299 So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life
1300 The prey of worms my body being dead
1301 The coward conquest of a wretch's knife
1302 Too base of thee to be remembered
1303 The worth of that is that which it contains
1304 And that is this and this with thee remains
1305 75
1306 So are you to my thoughts as food to life
1307 Or as sweetseasoned showers are to the ground
1308 And for the peace of you I hold such strife
1309 As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found
1310 Now proud as an enjoyer and anon
1311 Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure
1312 Now counting best to be with you alone
1313 Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure
1314 Sometime all full with feasting on your sight
1315 And by and by clean starved for a look
1316 Possessing or pursuing no delight
1317 Save what is had or must from you be took
1318 Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day
1319 Or gluttoning on all or all away
1320 76
1321 Why is my verse so barren of new pride
1322 So far from variation or quick change
1323 Why with the time do I not glance aside
1324 To newfound methods and to compounds strange
1325 Why write I still all one ever the same
1326 And keep invention in a noted weed
1327 That every word doth almost tell my name
1328 Showing their birth and where they did proceed
1329 O know sweet love I always write of you
1330 And you and love are still my argument
1331 So all my best is dressing old words new
1332 Spending again what is already spent
1333 For as the sun is daily new and old
1334 So is my love still telling what is told
1335 77
1336 Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
1337 Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
1338 These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear
1339 And of this book this learning mayst thou taste
1340 The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
1341 Of mouthed graves will give thee memory
1342 Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
1343 Time's thievish progress to eternity
1344 Look what thy memory cannot contain
1345 Commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find
1346 Those children nursed delivered from thy brain
1347 To take a new acquaintance of thy mind
1348 These offices so oft as thou wilt look
1349 Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book
1350 78
1351 So oft have I invoked thee for my muse
1352 And found such fair assistance in my verse
1353 As every alien pen hath got my use
1354 And under thee their poesy disperse
1355 Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
1356 And heavy ignorance aloft to fly
1357 Have added feathers to the learned's wing
1358 And given grace a double majesty
1359 Yet be most proud of that which I compile
1360 Whose influence is thine and born of thee
1361 In others works thou dost but mend the style
1362 And arts with thy sweet graces graced be
1363 But thou art all my art and dost advance
1364 As high as learning my rude ignorance
1365 79
1366 Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid
1367 My verse alone had all thy gentle grace
1368 But now my gracious numbers are decayed
1369 And my sick muse doth give an other place
1370 I grant sweet love thy lovely argument
1371 Deserves the travail of a worthier pen
1372 Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
1373 He robs thee of and pays it thee again
1374 He lends thee virtue and he stole that word
1375 From thy behaviour beauty doth he give
1376 And found it in thy cheek he can afford
1377 No praise to thee but what in thee doth live
1378 Then thank him not for that which he doth say
1379 Since what he owes thee thou thy self dost pay
1380 80
1381 O how I faint when I of you do write
1382 Knowing a better spirit doth use your name
1383 And in the praise thereof spends all his might
1384 To make me tonguetied speaking of your fame
1385 But since your worth wide as the ocean is
1386 The humble as the proudest sail doth bear
1387 My saucy bark inferior far to his
1388 On your broad main doth wilfully appear
1389 Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
1390 Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
1391 Or being wrecked I am a worthless boat
1392 He of tall building and of goodly pride
1393 Then if he thrive and I be cast away
1394 The worst was this my love was my decay
1395 81
1396 Or I shall live your epitaph to make
1397 Or you survive when I in earth am rotten
1398 From hence your memory death cannot take
1399 Although in me each part will be forgotten
1400 Your name from hence immortal life shall have
1401 Though I once gone to all the world must die
1402 The earth can yield me but a common grave
1403 When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie
1404 Your monument shall be my gentle verse
1405 Which eyes not yet created shall o'erread
1406 And tongues to be your being shall rehearse
1407 When all the breathers of this world are dead
1408 You still shall live such virtue hath my pen
1409 Where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men
1410 82
1411 I grant thou wert not married to my muse
1412 And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
1413 The dedicated words which writers use
1414 Of their fair subject blessing every book
1415 Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
1416 Finding thy worth a limit past my praise
1417 And therefore art enforced to seek anew
1418 Some fresher stamp of the timebettering days
1419 And do so love yet when they have devised
1420 What strained touches rhetoric can lend
1421 Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
1422 In true plain words by thy truetelling friend
1423 And their gross painting might be better used
1424 Where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused
1425 83
1426 I never saw that you did painting need
1427 And therefore to your fair no painting set
1428 I found or thought I found you did exceed
1429 That barren tender of a poet's debt
1430 And therefore have I slept in your report
1431 That you your self being extant well might show
1432 How far a modern quill doth come too short
1433 Speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
1434 This silence for my sin you did impute
1435 Which shall be most my glory being dumb
1436 For I impair not beauty being mute
1437 When others would give life and bring a tomb
1438 There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
1439 Than both your poets can in praise devise
1440 84
1441 Who is it that says most which can say more
1442 Than this rich praise that you alone are you
1443 In whose confine immured is the store
1444 Which should example where your
